# Modeling Experiments #
Modeling experiements were done so as to build a better EQTransformer. In order to do that we tried 14 different model in total. Four of them trained on _merged_. Whereas other two trained on _STEAD-micro_ and other eight trained on _STEADmini_.In each experiments we remove existing parts or add parts to existing code.

For simplicity, we will explain two best models for each training data.
